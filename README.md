# Building-a-rest-API-using-Django-Rest-Framework

This is a very simple application to demonstrate the use of Django REST Framework. 
Launch the app with:
[$python manage.py runserver]
then visit localhost:5000/myapi/ 

Django REST framework works with Django ORM and makes the serialization process exteremly neat for you. Also, the REST framework router works with a viewset
and enables dynamic routing of your requests.
